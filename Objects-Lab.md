## JavaScript Objects Lab

### Prerequisites

- JavaScript Fundamentals

### The Set Up

- You will need to create a new repository.
- Create new file called `Prompts.JS`
- Copy and paste prompts from lab into new file.
- Make sure to number the prompts you are answering in order to identify what is being answered.
- Complete the prompts below.

**Make one commit after each prompt you complete.**

### The Task

Take the following object:

```JS
const car = {
  make : "ford",
  model : "mustang",
  color : "black",
  type : "sedan",
  tires : "firestone",
  mode : "sport",
  gasoline : "super"
 }
```

#### Object Prompts

**Prompt 1:** Print the object above to the console.

**Prompt 2:** Write a function that takes an object as an argument and prints it to the console.

**Prompt 3:** Delete the `gasoline` property from the object. Also print the object before or after deleting the property.

**Prompt 4:** Write a function that returns the object keys as an array.

**Prompt 5:** Write a function that returns the object's values as an array.

**Prompt 6:** Add two more properties to the object `tints: 33%` and `carplay: true`. Print to the console to make sure properties were added.

**Prompt 7:** Add a method called `startEngine` with the following:

- When method is called, it prints "VROOM VROOM" to the console.
- Contains a variable `engineOn` with a boolean value set to `true`.

**Prompt 8:** Add a method called `turnOffEngine` with the following:

- When method is called, it prints "car turned off" to the console.
- Contains a variable `engineOn` with a boolean value set to `false`.

**Prompt 9:** Write a loop that iterates through the above object's properties. **Hint:** You will need to turn the object into an array using 1 of 3 object methods in order to loop through it.

**Prompt 10:** Using the directions below, create an object:

- Choose one of the following: `duck`, `eagle`, or `penguin`.
- Add an array to the object called `favoriteFood`, listing the 3-5 favorite foods of the bird.
- Provide the object with 4 `key:value` pairs, one of which being a boolean value named `canFly`.
- This object should contain 3 methods named `chirpSound`, `birdDiet`, and `fly`.
- The `fly` method must contain a conditional based on if the bird you chose can fly or not.
- If the bird can fly, the method when called will output `I live in the sky`, if not then the method will output `I'd like to stay on the ground`.

**Prompt 11:** Create another object called `house` that contains the following:

- A total of 10 key value pairs.
- 2 of the values should be booleans.
- Should contain 1 array.
- Should contain 3 methods.
- 1 method should contain a conditional.
- At least 1 of the values should be an object that has 3 key value pairs.
